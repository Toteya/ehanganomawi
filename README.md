## Background

Choral music lovers often want a convenient and reliable way to find their favourite songs. They also want to know how to, not only sing their favourite song, but to sing it the RIGHT way!

OMAWI is a good platform for this, with a large collection of the most popular choral songs, including a comprehensive collection of Oshiwambo songs.

Users can listen to the different voices of the melody (soprano, alto, tenor and bass) so they can learn how to sing it properly and even teach it to their choir friends.
